# Advent of Code 2024
Presumably will be done with only Go as a learning excercise.

## Setup
Each day will be self-contained. 

In general, this should mean that each day can be run individually.

Start by going into the folder for each day, and running the following commands.
```shell
$ go mod init
$ go run .
```
